Coconut
========================

Ok, I don't like coconuts. Sorry.

Coconut is a django app that cracks open Mozilla's status db. The views are 
not pretty, but try to expose as much about our data as I can find. It
intentionally doesn't try to tie any pieces together that aren't together
in the actual database. What you see is what you get.
